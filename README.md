# Grade Point Average Calculator by Ihsan Melih Sisman
<br> Write a program that takes the exam scores of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Turkish,
<br> History, Music courses from the user and calculates the averages and prints them on the screen with Java.
<br> Using conditional expressions in the same program, if the average of the user is greater than 60,
<br> the screen should write "Passed the Class" and if it is lower, "Failed in the Class".

# KDV Amount Calculator by Ihsan Melih Sisman
<br> Write a program that calculates the VAT value and the KDV amount of the money value received from the user with Java and prints it on the screen.
<br>         (Note: Take the KDV amount as 18%)
<br> 
<br>         Price without KDV = 10;
<br> 
<br>         Price with KDV = 11.8;
<br> 
<br>         VAT amount = 1.8;
<br> 
<br>         If the amount entered is between 0 and 1000 TL, the VAT rate is 18%, if the amount is greater than 1000 TL,
<br>         write the program that calculates the VAT amount as 8%.

# Program to Find Hypotenuse in Right Triangle by Ihsan Melih Sisman
<br>Write a program in Java that takes the length of the perpendicular sides from the user and calculates the hypotenuse.
<br>
<br>        Write a program that calculates the area of the triangle whose three side lengths you get from the user.
<br>        Formulas:
<br>        Perimeter of triangle = 2𝑢
<br>        𝑢 = (a+b+c) / 2
<br>        Area * Area = 𝑢 * (𝑢 − 𝑎)* (𝑢 − 𝑏) * (𝑢 − 𝑐)

# Taximeter Program By Ihsan Melih Sisman

<br>         Write a program that prints the taximeter amount on the screen according to the distance traveled (KM) with Java.

<br>        Taximeter costs 2.20 TL per km.

<br>        The minimum amount to be paid is 20 TL. 20 TL will be charged for the fees below 20 TL.

<br>        The taximeter opening fee is 10 TL.

# Program to Calculate Area and Perimeter of a Circle by Ihsan Melih Sisman

<br>         Write a program in Java that calculates the area and perimeter of a circle whose radius you get from the user.

<br>         Area Formula: π * r * r;

<br>         Perimeter Formula: 2 * π * r;
